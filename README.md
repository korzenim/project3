# Project 3 - Data Visualization Track

## Overview and Instructions

## Requirements:
1. Your project must include visualizations. The visualizations can be created with:
    - Python (e.g. Matplotlib, Pandas plotting, hvplot)
    - JavaScript (e.g. Plotly or Leaflet)
    - A Python or JavaScript visualization library that was not covered in class
2. Data must be stored in and extracted from at least one database (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, SQLite, etc). (OPTIONAL)
3. Your project must include at least one JavaScript OR Python library that we did not cover.
4. Your project must be powered by a dataset with at least 100 records.
5. Your project must include some level of user-driven interaction, such as: (OPTIONAL)
    - HTML menus, dropdowns, and/or textboxes to display JavaScript-powered visualizations
    - Flask backend with interactive API routes that serve back Python or JavaScript created plots.
    - Visualizations created from user-selected filtered data, which could be powered by:
        - JavaScript libraries
        - Python in Jupyter Notebook
        - Command-line Python scripts that save visualizations locally
    - Remember: You have learned how to filter data in Pandas, JavaScript, SQL, SQLAlchemy, and MongoDB.
6. If possible, your final visualization should ideally include at least three visualizations.
7. Your GitHub repo must include a README.md with an outline of the project including:
    - An overview of the project and its purpose
    - Instructions on how to use and interact with the project
    - At least one paragraph summarizing efforts for ethical considerations made in the project
    - References for the data source(s)
    - References for any code used that is not your own
